üëã Hi! I'm [Dave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himynamesdave/), the founder of dogesec (_pronounced Dohj-sec_).

Together, dogesec is a team of security nerds building no-nonsense cyber threat intelligence tools.

Our growing company is focused on the problems we want to solve and who we want to solve them for.

If you are a threat intelligence analyst who wants access to tooling that will drastically improve your effectiveness, you are among friends.

There are no hard sells. No marketing fluff. No vendor lock-in.

We post vendor agnostic content on [our blog](https://www.dogesec.com/blog/) to help pass on our knowledge.

We spend time addressing questions and taking part in debates on [our community forum](https://community.dogesec.com/).

All of our code is open-source and [published on GitHub](https://github.com/muchdogesec), much of it using an Apache 2.0 license.

We offer free versions of all our products to ensure end-users know they are right for their requirements (and we don't lock them into long licenses when they do become customers).

The simple fact is; we build products threat intelligence analysts love.

Take a look around and see how we might be able to help you (_...no promises!_).

-Dave, and the entire dogesec team ‚ù§Ô∏è
